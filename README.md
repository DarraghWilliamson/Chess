# Chess

Project has been abandoned in favour of a c++ implementation which will run 2-4 times faster than the current version.
Current version runs at approximately 1.8 - 2 million nodes per second (see perft results), has 3D graphics and is completely 
playable, the c++ version will be a console app with graphics possibly being added after completion.
